## Introduction
This project analyzes global university rankings using multiple datasets including Times Higher Education and Shanghai Rankings. We examine various ranking metrics including educational quality, employability, faculty resources, and research output.

## Datasets
- **Times Higher Education Dataset**: Contains 2000 universities with metrics like:
  - World Rank
  - Educational Rank
  - Employability Rank
  - Faculty Rank
  - Research Rank
  - Overall Score

- **Shanghai Ranking Dataset**: Contains 1000 universities with:
  - Global Ranking
  - National/Regional Rank
  - Total Score

## Key Findings
1. **Top Universities**: Harvard consistently ranks #1 across different ranking systems
2. **Employability Leaders**: 
   - Harvard University (USA)
   - INSEAD (France) 
   - Stanford University (USA)

3. **Saudi Arabian Universities**: Multiple institutions in global rankings, with positions ranging from 245 to 1979

4. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Strong correlation found between world rank and research output
   - Moderate correlation between employability and overall score

## Methodology
1. Data Cleaning:
   - Handled missing values
   - Standardized ranking formats
   - Removed duplicates

2. Analysis Techniques:
   - Univariate analysis for rank distributions
   - Correlation analysis between different ranking metrics
   - Geographic distribution analysis

## Visualizations
- Bar charts for top university comparisons
- Correlation heatmaps
- Scatter plots for rank relationships
- Geographic distribution plots
